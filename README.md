"A Brief History of Stable Diffusion Portraiture" is a series of five AI-generated portraits illustrating the evolution of Stable Diffusion's image synthesis capabilities from version 1.1 to 3.5. The project visually explores the rapid advancement of generative models in creating detailed, coherent, and aesthetically compelling portraits.

This repo contains the Jupyter notebooks I used to create the images for this project.
